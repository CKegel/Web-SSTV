# Web SSTV
## Summary
Web SSTV aims to both encode and decode SSTV using plain JavaScript and Web Audio API. Web SSTV can be run entirely offline (without styling), and on any platform from Chromebooks to phones, so long as they support JavaScript and Web Audio. By making SSTV readily available on many platforms, we aim to create educational opportunities and introduce more people to STEM and amateur radio. Web SSTV is currently hosted at https://ckegel.github.io/Web-SSTV/.
## Current State
Currently Web SSTV only supports encoding images using the Martin or Scottie formats. Support for more formats and recieving SSTV signals is actively being developed. We welcome any pull requests.
## Sources
Both the [SSTV Handbook](https://www.sstv-handbook.com/) and [JL Barber (N7CXI) paper](http://www.barberdsp.com/downloads/Dayton%20Paper.pdf) were heavily referenced when implementing support for the Martin and Scottie formats.
